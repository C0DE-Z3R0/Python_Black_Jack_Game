# Python_Black_Jack_Game
A simple console based black jack game written in python. This project was created for my own learning purposes and to practice Python fundamentals.

## How to Play
- Run the game in your terminal or command prompt.
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- You’ll play against the computer dealer.
- Type 'y' (draw a new card) or 'n' (end your turn).
- The dealer then reveals their cards and plays automatically.
